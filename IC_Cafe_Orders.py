"""My cake shop is so popular, I'm adding some tables and hiring wait staff so folks can have a cute sit-down
cake-eating experience.

I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe.
All the customer orders get combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come,
first-served.

Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders after them are getting their food first.
Yikesâ€”that's not good for business!

To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my laptop and recorded:

The goal of this program is to verify to make sure all orders placed through take-out and dine-in are accounted for
. The program must also verify orders being processed are following "First in First out". Whether the order is take-out
