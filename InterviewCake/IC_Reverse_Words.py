"""You're working on a secret team solving coded transmissions.

Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break into a major
European National Cake Vault. The message has been mostly deciphered, but all the words are backward!
Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.

Write a function reverse_words() that takes a message as a list of characters and
reverses the order of the words in place. â†´"""
