Hacker Rank Question Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/birthday-cake-candles/problem

- Candles on a birthday cake are being blown out by your niece, She can only blow out a particular height at time
- The function only needs to return the number of candles blown out at the tallest level.

My solution: Space Complexity: O(1)  Time Complexity: O(n)
"""


def bday_candles(ar):  # Where n is the number of staircases high
    tallest = max(ar)  # Tallest Candle on the birthday cake
    count = 0
    for i in ar:  # run through each index in the array
        if i == tallest:  # if that index in the array is equal to the tallest candle
            count += 1  # add it to the count of candles your niece can blow out
    return count


# Test input and output
